This solution helps you become compliant with green energy standards by giving you the tools to track your energy consumption across multiple buildings and energy types.

Once you're setup, you get out of the box widgets and dashboards for analyzing and tracking your energy consumption and green house emissions.

## Features

* Setup monthly budgets
* Setup budgets per energy type and building
* Dashboards and visualizations for measuring baseline against actuals
* Calculated energy types - create new energy types on the fly as a combination of other types.
* Metrics on greenhouse emissions

## Setup
This use case publishes an API that can be used to publish data as well as configure it.


### Energy Types
The first step is to configure your energy types. This can be done via API.
You can define energy type ids and labels for them.

You can also define calculated energy types as a sum of other energy types.

_(Note: you cannot currently calculate energy types on other calculated energy types)_

### Budgets
Once your energy types are setup - you can setup budgets per energy type per building.
Each budget consists of a `kWh` value for each month of the year (so 12 values need to specified)
